		<p>Howdy! My name is Gage Brower! I am a 15-year-old freshman, and I live in Grace, Idaho. I often enjoy interacting with people, although my social battery is low and I often need breaks. I enjoy researching random stuff and telling jokes. While it is not often recognized as a skill, I would say that my greatest skill is my curiosity; I enjoy researching things and often spend time going down random rabbit holes on the internet just researching random stuff.  I am great at coming up with ideas and solutions, and it is a fun pastime for me, thanks to my curiosity. I have a fair amount of knowledge and interest in mycology, genetic engineering, and biology.
